# Menu of Services

I can provide the following data science services, including a full spectrum of thought partnering (in case you just need someone to bounce an idea off of), training, guidance, and just performing the work myself. Please [contact me](https://twitter.com/bvancil) for details or if there's something not listed that you need.
